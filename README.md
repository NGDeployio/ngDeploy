*NGDeploy CLI*

> Angular and Static web hosting CLI tool.

Install this globally and you'll have access to the `ngdeploy` command anywhere on your system.

```shell
[sudo] npm install -g ngdeploy
```

**Note:** The job of the NGDeploy CLI is to upload and build single page applications. It's prefered to install globally, but local installations will work too. [please read this](http://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/npm-1-0-global-vs-local-installation).

<!--See the [Getting Started](http://ngdeploy.com/getting-started) guide for more information.-->
